	<h1>MY MAP</h1>

<div class="boxed" >
	<p> 
	I want to create something of a translation of memories. I want to begin by adding in some pictures, most of which I've taken over the last four years learning at OCAD, attached to the location which they were taken in. The map I have created here is of the small area north of Toronto, that I essentially grew up in. aNew Tecumseth is the area where I think I have the majority, and many of my recent memories. Essentially what I hope, is that this map will eventually become larger and larger and others will be able to interact with these photos, along with little reflections behind them. These reflections could also have soundtracks associated with them to help the user interact with the experience. This is still a very rough idea I'm working on, however, I'm very inspired by the idea of sharing memories, and providing a personal, visual map to do so.
